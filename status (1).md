Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?
I figured out how to create the hangman image using the print function and also how to run the program when it comes to guessing the word for hangman.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

No, I have started the project.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Although, I figured how to run the program to guess the word for hangman, I need to figure out how to connect the image I made of the print function to work in hand with the actual code that runs the hangman.
